## Project Overview

This kitty-tastic project is all about having fun while learning the magic of DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Picture this: cute cat paws that play musical notes when you click or press keys. It's a paw-some journey into the world of interactive web development!

## Features

- **Musical Purr-fection:** Each soft cat paw is a musical note, creating a delightful and charming melody.
- **Playful Interaction:** Engage with the keyboard using both mouse clicks and keyboard strokes for a whisker-twitching experience.
- **Adorable Visual Feedback:** Watch as the 'active' class temporarily transforms the pressed key into a paw print, adding a sprinkle of cuteness.

## How it Works

1. **Mouse Clicks:**
   - Give a little click on a paw to trigger the `playNote` function, and voila! Musical magic happens.
   - The 'active' class adds a cute paw print to the pressed key for visual joy.

2. **Keyboard Presses:**
   - Press those keys, and let the kitties play their notes! Each key has its own furry friend waiting to serenade you.
   - The 'active' class makes sure the pressed key leaves an adorable paw print behind.

3. **Magical Audio Playback:**
   - The `playNote` function handles the audio playback, ensuring a meow-velous musical experience.
   - The 'active' class disappears when the note finishes playing, leaving a trace of feline charm.
